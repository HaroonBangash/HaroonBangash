### **Hi there 👋 I am Haroon Bangash**



They call data the new oil, and I'm on a mission to strike it rich – not as a Sheikh, but as a modern-day data virtuoso. With algorithms as my compass and databases as my treasure troves, I'm here to prove that while I may not own deserts, I sure know how to make data oasis bloom. Join me in this adventure, where we turn raw data into polished gems, and where insights flow more abundantly than the finest crude.
